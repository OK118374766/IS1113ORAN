            <p>One of my earliest childhood memories is standing in the East Terrace of Musgrave Park(now Irish Independent Park) with my father, supporting Munster through thick and thin, rain, hail or shine.<br />
               I had little say as to whether I would be interested in rugby, as a result of my father's infectious enthusiasm for the sport famously invented by English schoolboy William Webb Ellis in 1823, when he allegedly picked up the ball during a school football game and ran with it.<br />
               Little has changed since those (usually rainy) days in Musgrave Park and my Dad and I still attend many Munster home-games each season. Rugby acts as a common interest that we share and bond over.</p>

            <h3 id="SubHeading" class="mb-0">Running</h3>
            
            
            <p>I can't remember when my love-affair with long-distance running began. Perhaps it is linked with my all-time favourite film, 'Forrest Gump' (1994), in which the protagonist goes on a run one day and keeps running for 3 years, 2 months, 14 days, and 16 hours. <br /> Though my runs tend to be less extreme in nature, usually 5/10km, I have had the line "Run Forrest Run", yelled in my direction on one occasion! <br />I find running to be a wonderful means of clearing my head and I am of the firm opinion that there are few things more beneficial to one's mental health, particularly in this day and age, than going for a run in the fresh air. </p>
