            <p>I was first introduced to the Information Technology Consultancy realm in Transition Year.
               I was lucky enough to undertake my work experience in BlueFin Payment Systems, a local IT firm.
               Though upon my arrival I was unfamiliar with many of the technologies utilised in the firm, 
               my supervisor (the regional manager) gave me great insight into these technologies during my time 
               there.<br />My supervisor informed me that she was also an IT consultant. 
               When I expressed an interest in learning more about IT consultancy, she informed me of the skills 
               that an IT consultant needs to possess, namely :</p>

            <p>As mentioned previously, my time at BlueFin Payment Systems succeeded in introducing me to the IT 
               consultancy realm. I have great interest in this field, perhaps as a result of the fond memories 
               that I have of giving guitar lessons when I was in school.<br /> When applying for the CAO, I was unsure 
               as to whether to put Business Information Systems or Education as my first choice, hence, 
               IT Consultancy represents an enticing choice that combines these two interests of mine.</p>
