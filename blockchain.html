            <p>When we say the words “block” and “chain” in this context, we are actually talking about digital information (the “block”) stored in a public database (the “chain”).</p>
“Blocks” on the blockchain are made up of digital pieces of information. Specifically, they have three parts:
<ol>
    <li>Blocks store information about transactions, say the date, time, and euro 
        amount of your most recent purchase.</li>
        
    <li>Blocks store information about who is participating in transactions. 
        A block would record your purchase using a unique “digital signature".</li>
        
    <li>Blocks store information that distinguishes them from other blocks. 
        Each block stores a unique code called a “hash” that allows us to tell it apart from every other block.</li>
</ol>
<p>
    A single block on the blockchain can store up to 1 MB of data. Depending on the size of the transactions, that means a single block can house a few thousand transactions under one roof.

            <p>

When a block stores new data it is added to the blockchain. Blockchain, as its name suggests, consists of multiple blocks strung together. In order for a block to be added to the blockchain, however, four things must happen:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>A transaction must occur.</li>

                <li>That transaction must be verified. With other public records of information, like the Securities Exchange Commission or Wikipedia, there’s someone in charge of vetting new data entries. With blockchain, however, that job is left up to a network of computers. These networks often consist of thousands (or in the case of Bitcoin, about 5 million) computers spread across the globe. When you make your purchase, that network of computers confirm the details of the purchase, including the transaction’s time, euro amount, and participants.</li>

                <li>That transaction must be stored in a block. After your transaction has been verified as accurate, it gets the green light. The transaction’s euro amount and your digital signature are all stored in a block.</li>

                <li>That block must be given a hash. Once all of a block’s transactions have been verified, it must be given a unique, identifying code called a hash. The block is also given the hash of the most recent block added to the blockchain. Once hashed, the block can be added to the blockchain.</li>
            </ol>
<p>
When that new block is added to the blockchain, it becomes publicly available for anyone to view.
