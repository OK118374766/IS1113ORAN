            <p>An immersive experience is an illusory environment that completely surrounds 
                you such that you feel that you are inside it and part of it. The term is 
                associated with technology environments that command the senses such as 
                virtual reality and mixed reality.  Various immersive technologies such as gestural 
                controls, motion tracking, and computer vision respond to the user's actions and movements. 
                Brain control interfaces (BCI) respond to the user's brainwave activity.

            <p>Specsavers offer a service which allows customers to choose the pair of glasses 
                that they like, no matter where they are. The user takes three pictures of 
                their face (two side-on pictures and one 'selfie'), the Specsavers app then uses 
                AR to edit the picture to show the user what the glasses would look like on 
                them from each angle. I believe that this simple application is indicative
                of how prominent this technology may become across countless aspects of our lives.<br /><br />
                Immersive technology is utilised by companies such as Oculus for gaming and entertainment purposes.
                In Transition Year, I had the opportunity to trial an Oculus headset that made me feel as if I
                was on a rollercoaster. Though the visuals were not truly believable,
                it is hard to imagine that this technology won't grow exponentially in the future.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Education</b> - Pulling digital elements into the classroom with mixed 
                    reality or transforming the learning environment with virtual reality. 
                    For example, exploring the surface of Mars as part of a science lesson.</li>
                
                <li> 
                    <b>Art</b> - Contemporary art that is designed to surround the visitor. 
                    Immersive experiences can be accomplished without technology as art can 
                    transform reality on its own.</li>
                
               
                
                <li>
                    <b>Entertainment</b> - Theme parks, movies and games that completely surround 
                    you. This includes pervasive games that draw virtual elements into the 
                    real world.</li>
                
                <li>
                    <b>Fitness</b> - Physical activity in a virtual environment that may resemble 
                    a game or provide you with excessive real time information about your body.</li>
                
                <li>
                    <b>Efficiency</b> - Avoiding the cost of travel by simulating work environments. 
                    For example, attending a virtual conference.</li>
                
                <li>
                    <b>Productivity</b> - Integration of digital elements into work environments as 
                    a tool that makes people more productive. For example, a video editor that 
                    steps into a film to edit it.</li>
                
                <li>
                    <b>Risk</b> - Tools to reduce risk. For example, mixed reality that provides a 
                    surgeon with informative visuals such as highlighting or labeling diseased 
                    tissue during surgery that increase accuracy and reduces the chance of a 
                    mistake.</li>
            </ul>
