            <p>'Consultants of Swing', was the brainchild of Christopher Farrell who, upon achieving his MBA in 2011, 
                decided to pursue his passion of educating others. As a result, 'Consultants of Swing', was founded with the vision of providing high-level consultancy to IT firms, with an emphasis on small-medium start-ups.</p>

            <p>Over the past 7 years, 'Consultants of Swing', have grown dramatically, now employing
            75 employees across the country. With our Headquarters remaining in Waterford, our services can be
            attained nationwide, with operations in Dublin, Cork, Galway, Meath and Waterford.
            Our national hold is ever-increasing with a Limerick-based operation currently in development, 
            scheduled to be finished by 2020.<br />Each of these operations boasts a highly-qualified staff 
            consisting of consultants who all have a breadth of knowledge across the Information Technology realm
            along with specialist knowledge of topics such as 'Blockchain', 'Autonomous Things' and
            'Immersive Experience'.

            <p>The success of our National Operation has afforded us the opportunity and given us the 
            confidence to expand our operations to other English-speaking countries across the globe.
            Plans are currently in place to have a UK operation by 2021 and depending on it's success,
            a US operation by 2025.<br/>These are truly exciting times for our firm and the sky is the limit.
            Thank you to all patrons who have made this possible.</p>
