             <p>I began learning the guitar at 8 years of age when I received a small-body guitar for my birthday. Music has been a passion of mine ever since. One of my favourite aspects of music is that since I began gigging in Transition Year(after many years of busking and playing open-mic nights) it has given me the opportunity to visit many new locations, some in the general locality and some further afield including Castletown, Co.Louth and . I feel that Irish natives, myself included, often take for granted the natural beauty of our country with spots such as the Giant's Causeway a world-renowned destination. </p>

            <p>From a young age, I have been fortunate enough to have been given the opportunity to see many corners of the world, through travelling with my family each summer. My father's job requires that he travels to various global locations on a frequent basis, therefore we often travelled with him during the summer's visiting locations in France, USA and even Australia.

I relish these trips and find that as a result of having travelled during my childhood I have a better understanding of other cultures and it also helped me with studying French in school!</p>
