             <p>I began learning the guitar at 8 years of age when I received a small-body guitar for my birthday. Music has been a passion of mine ever since. One of my favourite aspects of music is that since I began gigging in Transition Year(after many years of busking and playing open-mic nights) it has given me the opportunity to visit many new locations, some in the general locality and some further afield including Castletown, Co.Louth and . I feel that Irish natives, myself included, often take for granted the natural beauty of our country with spots such as the Giant's Causeway a world-renowned destination. </p>

            <p>I can't remember when my love-affair with long-distance running began. Perhaps it is linked with my all-time favourite film, 'Forrest Gump' (1994), in which the protagonist goes on a run one day and keeps running for 3 years, 2 months, 14 days, and 16 hours. <br /> Though my runs tend to be less extreme in nature, usually 5/10km, I have had the line "Run Forrest Run", yelled in my direction on one occasion! <br />I find running to be a wonderful means of clearing my head and I am of the firm opinion that there are few things more beneficial to one's mental health, particularly in this day and age, than going for a run in the fresh air. </p>
