            <p>During Gartner Symposium/ITxpo in Orlando, analysts highlighted the “top 10 strategic 
                technology trends” to look out for in 2019. Autonomous things was the first tech trend on Gartner’s list.<br /><br />
                Autonomous things(AuT), also known as the Internet of Autonomous Things (IoAT), is an emerging term for the technological developments that are expected to bring computers 
                into the physical environment as autonomous entities without human direction, 
                freely moving and interacting with humans and other objects.</p>

            <h3 id="SubHeading" class="mb-0">Current Uses of Autonomous Things</h3>
            
            <p>Computer programs are among the most well-developed applications 
                of autonomous technology nowadays. For example, sophisticated supply chain 
                management programs are capable of evaluating and reacting to needs such as 
                ordering supplies, scheduling workers and so on without human involvement – 
                going beyond simple automation.<br /><br />
                
            Driverless technologies are already utilized in cars – for example, cars that can park 
            themselves into tight spaces, or automatically brake when they get too close to another 
            car or object.<br /><br />
            A notable use of Autonomous technology was Intel’s use of a drone swarm for the 
            opening ceremony of the Winter Olympic Games in 2018.

            <h3 id="SubHeading" class="mb-0">Future Applications</h3>
           
            <p> The presence of truly driverless cars will soon be a reality. Ford, Nissan, Google, BMW, 
                General Motors, and Daimler are just a few of the big names working toward this goal.<br /> 
                It must be noted that data security is of particular importance with this potential application, as the 
                implications of hacking could be dangerous or life-threatening. <br /><br />
                Major advancements in the Autonomous Things field are predicted to be upon us with a few years. 
                Gartner predicts that by 2021, swarm intelligence will be a core design element for at least 30 percent 
                of organizations deploying AI-enhanced systems. <br />
                Gartner also predict that by 2021, 10 percent of new vehicles will have autonomous 
                driving capabilities, compared to less than one percent in 2018.</p>
